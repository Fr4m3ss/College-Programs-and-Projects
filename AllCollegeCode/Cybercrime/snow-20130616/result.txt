officer of the court, except persons on active duty in the militia when
tried by courts martial.
(b) When authorized by law, a child as therein defined may be charged
with a violation of law as an act of delinquency instead of crime and

Any child so charged shall, upon demand made as provided by law before a
trial in a juvenile proceeding, be tried in an appropriate court as an
adult. A child found delinquent shall be disciplined as provided by law.
SECTION 16. Rights of accused and of victims.—
(a) In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall, upon demand, be
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, and shall be

compulsory process for witnesses, to confront at trial adverse
witnesses, to be heard in person, by counsel or both, and to have a
speedy and public trial by impartial jury in the county where the crime
was committed. If the county is not known, the indictment or information
may charge venue in two or more counties conjunctively and proof that
the crime was committed in that area shall be sufficient; but before
pleading the accused may elect in which of those counties the trial will
take place. Venue for prosecution of crimes committed beyond the
boundaries of the state shall be fixed by law.
(b) To preserve and protect the right of crime victims to achieve
justice, ensure a meaningful role throughout the criminal and juvenile
justice systems for crime victims, and ensure that crime victims’ rights
and interests are respected and protected by law in a manner no less
vigorous than protections afforded to criminal defendants and juvenile
delinquents, every victim is entitled to the following rights, beginning
at the time of his or her victimization:
(1) The right to due process and to be treated with fairness and respect
for the victim’s dignity.
(2) The right to be free from intimidation, harassment, and abuse.
(3) The right, within the judicial process, to be reasonably protected
from the accused and any person acting on behalf of the accused.
However, nothing contained herein is intended to create a special
relationship between the crime victim and any law enforcement agency or
office absent a special relationship or duty as defined by Florida law.
(4) The right to have the safety and welfare of the victim and the
victim’s family considered when setting bail, including setting pretrial
release conditions that protect the safety and welfare of the victim and
the victim’s family.
(5) The right to prevent the disclosure of information or records that
could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim’s family, or
which could disclose confidential or privileged information of the victim.
(6) A victim shall have the following specific rights upon request:
a. The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be
present at, all public proceedings involving the criminal conduct,
including, but not limited to, trial, plea, sentencing, or adjudication,
even if the victim will be a witness at the proceeding, notwithstanding
any rule to the contrary. A victim shall also be provided reasonable,
accurate, and timely notice of any release or escape of the defendant or
delinquent, and any proceeding during which a right of the victim is
implicated.
b. The right to be heard in any public proceeding involving pretrial or
other release from any form of legal constraint, plea, sentencing,
adjudication, or parole, and any proceeding during which a right of the
victim is implicated.
c. The right to confer with the prosecuting attorney concerning any plea
agreements, participation in pretrial diversion programs, release,
restitution, sentencing, or any other disposition of the case.
d. The right to provide information regarding the impact of the
offender’s conduct on the victim and the victim’s family to the
individual responsible for conducting any presentence investigation or
compiling any presentence investigation report, and to have any such
information considered in any sentencing recommendations submitted to
the court.
e. The right to receive a copy of any presentence report, and any other
report or record relevant to the exercise of a victim’s right, except
for such portions made confidential or exempt by law.
f. The right to be informed of the conviction, sentence, adjudication,
place and time of incarceration, or other disposition of the convicted
offender, any scheduled release date of the offender, and the release of
or the escape of the offender from custody.
g. The right to be informed of all postconviction processes and
procedures, to participate in such processes and procedures, to provide
information to the release authority to be considered before any release
decision is made, and to be notified of any release decision regarding
the offender. The parole or early release authority shall extend the
right to be heard to any person harmed by the offender.
h. The right to be informed of clemency and expungement procedures, to
provide information to the governor, the court, any clemency board, and
other authority in these procedures, and to have that information
considered before a clemency or expungement decision is made; and to be
notified of such decision in advance of any release of the offender.
(7) The rights of the victim, as provided in subparagraph (6)a.,
subparagraph (6)b., or subparagraph (6)c., that apply to any first
appearance proceeding are satisfied by a reasonable attempt by the
appropriate agency to notify the victim and convey the victim’s views to
the court.
(8) The right to the prompt return of the victim’s property when no
longer needed as evidence in the case.
(9) The right to full and timely restitution in every case and from each
convicted offender for all losses suffered, both directly and
indirectly, by the victim as a result of the criminal conduct.
(10) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, and to a
prompt and final conclusion of the case and any related postjudgment
proceedings.
a. The state attorney may file a good faith demand for a speedy trial
and the trial court shall hold a calendar call, with notice, within
fifteen days of the filing demand, to schedule a trial to commence on a
date at least five days but no more than sixty days after the date of
the calendar call unless the trial judge enters an order with specific
findings of fact justifying a trial date more than sixty days after the
calendar call.
b. All state-level appeals and collateral attacks on any judgment must
be complete within two years from the date of appeal in non-capital
cases and within five years from the date of appeal in capital cases,
unless a court enters an order with specific findings as to why the
court was unable to comply with this subparagraph and the circumstances
causing the delay. Each year, the chief judge of any district court of
appeal or the chief justice of the supreme court shall report on a
case-by-case basis to the speaker of the house of representatives and
the president of the senate all cases where the court entered an order
regarding inability to comply with this subparagraph. The legislature
may enact legislation to implement this subparagraph.
(11) The right to be informed of these rights, and to be informed that
victims can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to their rights.
This information shall be made available to the general public and
provided to all crime victims in the form of a card or by other means
intended to effectively advise the victim of their rights under this
section.
(c) The victim, the retained attorney of the victim, a lawful
representative of the victim, or the office of the state attorney upon
request of the victim, may assert and seek enforcement of the rights
enumerated in this section and any other right afforded to a victim by
law in any trial or appellate court, or before any other authority with
jurisdiction over the case, as a matter of right. The court or other
authority with jurisdiction shall act promptly on such a request,
affording a remedy by due course of law for the violation of any right.
The reasons for any decision regarding the disposition of a victim’s
right shall be clearly stated on the record.
(d) The granting of the rights enumerated in this section to victims may
not be construed to deny or impair any other rights possessed by
victims. The provisions of this section apply throughout criminal and
juvenile justice processes, are self-executing, and do not require
implementing legislation. This section may not be construed to create
any cause of action for damages against the state or a political
subdivision of the state, or any officer, employee, or agent of the
state or its political subdivisions.
(e) As used in this section, a “victim” is a person who suffers direct
or threatened physical, psychological, or financial harm as a result of
the commission or attempted commission of a crime or delinquent act or
against whom the crime or delinquent act is committed. The term “victim”
includes the victim’s lawful representative, the parent or guardian of a
minor, or the next of kin of a homicide victim, except upon a showing
that the interest of such individual would be in actual or potential
conflict with the interests of the victim. The term “victim” does not
include the accused. The terms “crime” and “criminal” include delinquent
acts and conduct.

provide by general law passed by a two-thirds vote of each house for the
exemption of records from the requirements of subsection (a) and the
exemption of meetings from the requirements of subsection (b), provided
that such law shall state with specificity the public necessity
justifying the exemption and shall be no broader than necessary to
accomplish the stated purpose of the law. The legislature shall enact

maintenance, control, destruction, disposal, and disposition of records
made public by this section, except that each house of the legislature
may adopt rules governing the enforcement of this section in relation to

and county court judges by merit selection and retention rather than by

election in the year 2000. If a vote to exercise this local option fails
in a vote of the electors, such option shall not again be put to a vote
of the electors of that jurisdiction until the expiration of at least
two years.
b. After the year 2000, a circuit may initiate the local option for
merit selection and retention or the election of circuit judges,
whichever is applicable, by filing with the custodian of state records a
petition signed by the number of electors equal to at least ten percent
of the votes cast in the circuit in the last preceding election in which
presidential electors were chosen.
c. After the year 2000, a county may initiate the local option for merit
selection and retention or the election of county court judges,

first Monday in January of the year following the next primary and
general election occurring at least one year after the date of

during term of office or otherwise occurring on or after November 1,
1966, (without regard to the effective date of this section)
demonstrates a present unfitness to hold office, and to investigate and
recommend the discipline of a justice or judge whose conduct, during
term of office or otherwise occurring on or after November 1, 1966
(without regard to the effective date of this section), warrants such
discipline. For purposes of this section, discipline is defined as any
or all of the following: reprimand, fine, suspension with or without
pay, or lawyer discipline. The commission shall have jurisdiction over
justices and judges regarding allegations that misconduct occurred
before or during service as a justice or judge if a complaint is made no

commission shall have jurisdiction regarding allegations of incapacity
during service as a justice or judge. The commission shall be composed of:

courts;
b. Four electors who reside in the state, who are members of the bar of
Florida, and who shall be chosen by the governing body of the bar of

its members as its chairperson.
(3) Members of the judicial qualifications commission not subject to
impeachment shall be subject to removal from the commission pursuant to
the provisions of Article IV, Section 7, Florida Constitution.
(4) The commission shall adopt rules regulating its proceedings, the
filling of vacancies by the appointing authorities, the disqualification
of members, the rotation of members between the panels, and the
temporary replacement of disqualified or incapacitated members. The
commission’s rules, or any part thereof, may be repealed by general law
enacted by a majority vote of the membership of each house of the
legislature, or by the supreme court, five justices concurring. The
commission shall have power to issue subpoenas. Until formal charges
against a justice or judge are filed by the investigative panel with the
clerk of the supreme court of Florida all proceedings by or before the
commission shall be confidential; provided, however, upon a finding of
probable cause and the filing by the investigative panel with said clerk
of such formal charges against a justice or judge such charges and all
further proceedings before the commission shall be public.

the hearing panel. The hearing panel is vested with the authority to
receive and hear formal charges from the investigative panel and upon a
two-thirds vote of the panel recommend to the supreme court the removal
of a justice or judge or the involuntary retirement of a justice or
judge for any permanent disability that seriously interferes with the
performance of judicial duties. Upon a simple majority vote of the
membership of the hearing panel, the panel may recommend to the supreme
court that the justice or judge be subject to appropriate discipline.
(c) SUPREME COURT.—The supreme court shall receive recommendations from
the judicial qualifications commission’s hearing panel.
(1) The supreme court may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part
the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the commission and it
may order that the justice or judge be subjected to appropriate
discipline, or be removed from office with termination of compensation
for willful or persistent failure to perform judicial duties or for
other conduct unbecoming a member of the judiciary demonstrating a
present unfitness to hold office, or be involuntarily retired for any
permanent disability that seriously interferes with the performance of
judicial duties. Malafides, scienter or moral turpitude on the part of a
justice or judge shall not be required for removal from office of a
justice or judge whose conduct demonstrates a present unfitness to hold
office. After the filing of a formal proceeding and upon request of the
investigative panel, the supreme court may suspend the justice or judge
from office, with or without compensation, pending final determination
of the inquiry.
(2) The supreme court may award costs to the prevailing party.
(d) The power of removal conferred by this section shall be both
alternative and cumulative to the power of impeachment.

justices of such court with respect to all proceedings therein
concerning such person and the supreme court for such purposes shall be
composed of a panel consisting of the seven chief judges of the judicial
circuits of the state of Florida most senior in tenure of judicial

circuit judges in the event there be judges of equal tenure in judicial
office as circuit judge the judge or judges from the lower numbered
circuit or circuits shall be deemed senior. In the event any such chief
circuit judge is under investigation by the judicial qualifications
commission or is otherwise disqualified or unable to serve on the panel,
the next most senior chief circuit judge or judges shall serve in place
of such disqualified or disabled chief circuit judge.

shall take effect December 31, 2022; except that the amendments to
Section 8(h) of Article II shall take effect December 31, 2020.”
Effective December 31, 2022, s. 13, Art. V, as amended by Constitution
Revision Commission, Revision No. 7 (2018), will read:

SECTION 13. Ethics in the judiciary.—

(a) All justices and judges shall devote full time to their judicial
duties. A justice or judge shall not engage in the practice of law or
hold office in any political party.

(b) A former justice or former judge shall not lobby for compensation on
issues of policy, appropriations, or procurement before the legislative
or executive branches of state government for a period of six years
after he or she vacates his or her judicial position. The legislature
may enact legislation to implement this subsection, including, but not
limited to, defining terms and providing penalties for violations. Any
such law shall not contain provisions on any other subject.

SECTION 14. Funding.—
(a) All justices and judges shall be compensated only by state salaries
fixed by general law. Funding for the state courts system, state
attorneys’ offices, public defenders’ offices, and court-appointed
counsel, except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), shall be
provided from state revenues appropriated by general law.
(b) All funding for the offices of the clerks of the circuit and county
courts performing court-related functions, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection and subsection (c), shall be provided by adequate and

costs for performing court-related functions as required by general law.
Selected salaries, costs, and expenses of the state courts system may be

charges and costs for performing court-related functions, as provided by
general law. Where the requirements of either the United States
Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Florida preclude the
imposition of filing fees for judicial proceedings and service charges
and costs for performing court-related functions sufficient to fund the
court-related functions of the offices of the clerks of the circuit and

property. All other forms of taxation shall be preempted to the state
except as provided by general law.
(b) Motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, trailers, trailer coaches and

State revenues collected for any fiscal year in excess of this
limitation shall be transferred to the budget stabilization fund until
the fund reaches the maximum balance specified in Section 19(g) of

revenues allowed will be increased. The vote may not be taken less than
seventy-two hours after the third reading of the bill. For purposes of
this subsection, “state revenues” means taxes, fees, licenses, and
charges for services imposed by the legislature on individuals,
businesses, or agencies outside state government. However, “state
revenues” does not include: revenues that are necessary to meet the
requirements set forth in documents authorizing the issuance of bonds by
the state; revenues that are used to provide matching funds for the

support the Public Medical Assistance Trust Fund or its successor
program and with the exception of state matching funds used to fund
elective expansions made after July 1, 1994; proceeds from the state
lottery returned as prizes; receipts of the Florida Hurricane
Catastrophe Fund; balances carried forward from prior fiscal years;
taxes, licenses, fees, and charges for services imposed by local,
regional, or school district governing bodies; or revenue from taxes,
licenses, fees, and charges for services required to be imposed by any
amendment or revision to this constitution after July 1, 1994. An
adjustment to the revenue limitation shall be made by general law to
reflect the fiscal impact of transfers of responsibility for the funding
of governmental functions between the state and other levels of
government. The legislature shall, by general law, prescribe procedures
necessary to administer this subsection.

by law to be in lieu of all other intangible assessments on such
obligations.

educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes may
be exempted by general law from taxation.

permanently disabled, property to the value fixed by general law not
less than five hundred dollars.
(c) Any county or municipality may, for the purpose of its respective
tax levy and subject to the provisions of this subsection and general
law, grant community and economic development ad valorem tax exemptions
to new businesses and expansions of existing businesses, as defined by
general law. Such an exemption may be granted only by ordinance of the
county or municipality, and only after the electors of the county or
municipality voting on such question in a referendum authorize the
county or municipality to adopt such ordinances. An exemption so granted
shall apply to improvements to real property made by or for the use of a
new business and improvements to real property related to the expansion
of an existing business and shall also apply to tangible personal
property of such new business and tangible personal property related to
the expansion of an existing business. The amount or limits of the
amount of such exemption shall be specified by general law. The period
of time for which such exemption may be granted to a new business or

real property encumbered by perpetual conservation easements or by other
perpetual conservation protections, as defined by general law.

person who receives a homestead exemption as provided in section 6 of
this article; who was a member of the United States military or military
reserves, the United States Coast Guard or its reserves, or the Florida
National Guard; and who was deployed during the preceding calendar year
on active duty outside the continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii
in support of military operations designated by the legislature shall
receive an additional exemption equal to a percentage of the taxable
value of his or her homestead property. The applicable percentage shall
be calculated as the number of days during the preceding calendar year
the person was deployed on active duty outside the continental United

SECTION 6. Homestead exemptions.—
(a) Every person who has the legal or equitable title to real estate and
maintains thereon the permanent residence of the owner, or another
legally or naturally dependent upon the owner, shall be exempt from
taxation thereon, except assessments for special benefits, up to the
assessed valuation of twenty-five thousand dollars and, for all levies
other than school district levies, on the assessed valuation greater
than fifty thousand dollars and up to seventy-five thousand dollars,
upon establishment of right thereto in the manner prescribed by law. The
real estate may be held by legal or equitable title, by the entireties,
jointly, in common, as a condominium, or indirectly by stock ownership
or membership representing the owner’s or member’s proprietary interest
in a corporation owning a fee or a leasehold initially in excess of
ninety-eight years. The exemption shall not apply with respect to any
assessment roll until such roll is first determined to be in compliance
with the provisions of section 4 by a state agency designated by general
law. This exemption is repealed on the effective date of any amendment
to this Article which provides for the assessment of homestead property
at less than just value.
(b) Not more than one exemption shall be allowed any individual or
family unit or with respect to any residential unit. No exemption shall
exceed the value of the real estate assessable to the owner or, in case
of ownership through stock or membership in a corporation, the value of
the proportion which the interest in the corporation bears to the
assessed value of the property.
(c) By general law and subject to conditions specified therein, the
Legislature may provide to renters, who are permanent residents, ad
valorem tax relief on all ad valorem tax levies. Such ad valorem tax
relief shall be in the form and amount established by general law.
1(d) The legislature may, by general law, allow counties or
municipalities, for the purpose of their respective tax levies and
subject to the provisions of general law, to grant either or both of the
following additional homestead tax exemptions:
(1) An exemption not exceeding fifty thousand dollars to a person who
has the legal or equitable title to real estate and maintains thereon
the permanent residence of the owner, who has attained age sixty-five,
and whose household income, as defined by general law, does not exceed
twenty thousand dollars; or
(2) An exemption equal to the assessed value of the property to a person
who has the legal or equitable title to real estate with a just value
less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as determined in the
first tax year that the owner applies and is eligible for the exemption,
and who has maintained thereon the permanent residence of the owner for
not less than twenty-five years, who has attained age sixty-five, and
whose household income does not exceed the income limitation prescribed
in paragraph (1).

The general law must allow counties and municipalities to grant these
additional exemptions, within the limits prescribed in this subsection,
by ordinance adopted in the manner prescribed by general law, and must
provide for the periodic adjustment of the income limitation prescribed
in this subsection for changes in the cost of living.

(e)(1) Each veteran who is age 65 or older who is partially or totally
permanently disabled shall receive a discount from the amount of the ad
valorem tax otherwise owed on homestead property the veteran owns and
resides in if the disability was combat related and the veteran was
honorably discharged upon separation from military service. The discount
shall be in a percentage equal to the percentage of the veteran’s
permanent, service-connected disability as determined by the United
States Department of Veterans Affairs. To qualify for the discount
granted by this paragraph, an applicant must submit to the county
property appraiser, by March 1, an official letter from the United
States Department of Veterans Affairs stating the percentage of the
veteran’s service-connected disability and such evidence that reasonably
identifies the disability as combat related and a copy of the veteran’s
honorable discharge. If the property appraiser denies the request for a
discount, the appraiser must notify the applicant in writing of the
reasons for the denial, and the veteran may reapply. The Legislature
may, by general law, waive the annual application requirement in
subsequent years.
(2) If a veteran who receives the discount described in paragraph (1)
predeceases his or her spouse, and if, upon the death of the veteran,
the surviving spouse holds the legal or beneficial title to the
homestead property and permanently resides thereon, the discount carries
over to the surviving spouse until he or she remarries or sells or
otherwise disposes of the homestead property. If the surviving spouse
sells or otherwise disposes of the property, a discount not to exceed
the dollar amount granted from the most recent ad valorem tax roll may
be transferred to the surviving spouse’s new homestead property, if used
as his or her permanent residence and he or she has not remarried.
(3) This subsection is self-executing and does not require implementing
legislation.
(f) By general law and subject to conditions and limitations specified
therein, the Legislature may provide ad valorem tax relief equal to the
total amount or a portion of the ad valorem tax otherwise owed on
homestead property to:
(1) The surviving spouse of a veteran who died from service-connected
causes while on active duty as a member of the United States Armed Forces.
(2) The surviving spouse of a first responder who died in the line of duty.
(3) A first responder who is totally and permanently disabled as a
result of an injury or injuries sustained in the line of duty. Causal
connection between a disability and service in the line of duty shall
not be presumed but must be determined as provided by general law. For
purposes of this paragraph, the term “disability” does not include a
chronic condition or chronic disease, unless the injury sustained in the
line of duty was the sole cause of the chronic condition or chronic disease.

As used in this subsection and as further defined by general law, the
term “first responder” means a law enforcement officer, a correctional
officer, a firefighter, an emergency medical technician, or a paramedic,
and the term “in the line of duty” means arising out of and in the
actual performance of duty required by employment as a first responder.

sources, or during a fiscal emergency declared in a written joint
proclamation issued by the president of the senate and the speaker of
the house of representatives, or where the legislature provides
additional state-shared revenues which are anticipated to be sufficient
to replace the anticipated aggregate loss of state-shared revenues
resulting from the reduction of the percentage of the state tax shared
with counties and municipalities, which source of replacement revenues
shall be subject to the same requirements for repeal or modification as
provided herein for a state-shared tax source existing on February 1, 1989.

SECTION 5.  Superintendent of schools.

SECTION 1. Public education.—
(a) The education of children is a fundamental value of the people of
the State of Florida. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the state to
make adequate provision for the education of all children residing
within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a
uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public
schools that allows students to obtain a high quality education and for
the establishment, maintenance, and operation of institutions of higher
learning and other public education programs that the needs of the
people may require. To assure that children attending public schools
obtain a high quality education, the legislature shall make adequate
provision to ensure that, by the beginning of the 2010 school year,
there are a sufficient number of classrooms so that:
(1) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who
is teaching in public school classrooms for prekindergarten through
grade 3 does not exceed 18 students;
(2) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who
is teaching in public school classrooms for grades 4 through 8 does not
exceed 22 students; and
(3) The maximum number of students who are assigned to each teacher who
is teaching in public school classrooms for grades 9 through 12 does not
exceed 25 students.

The class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to
extracurricular classes. Payment of the costs associated with reducing
class size to meet these requirements is the responsibility of the state
and not of local schools districts. Beginning with the 2003-2004 fiscal
year, the legislature shall provide sufficient funds to reduce the
average number of students in each classroom by at least two students
per year until the maximum number of students per classroom does not
exceed the requirements of this subsection.

(b) Every four-year old child in Florida shall be provided by the State
a high quality pre-kindergarten learning opportunity in the form of an
early childhood development and education program which shall be
voluntary, high quality, free, and delivered according to professionally
accepted standards. An early childhood development and education program
means an organized program designed to address and enhance each child’s
ability to make age appropriate progress in an appropriate range of
settings in the development of language and cognitive capabilities and
emotional, social, regulatory and moral capacities through education in
basic skills and such other skills as the Legislature may determine to
be appropriate.
(c) The early childhood education and development programs provided by
reason of subparagraph (b) shall be implemented no later than the
beginning of the 2005 school year through funds generated in addition to
those used for existing education, health, and development programs.
Existing education, health, and development programs are those funded by
the State as of January 1, 2002 that provided for child or adult
education, health care, or development.

minimum wage that is sufficient to provide a decent and healthy life for
them and their families, that protects their employers from unfair
low-wage competition, and that does not force them to rely on
taxpayer-funded public services in order to avoid economic hardship.
(b) DEFINITIONS. As used in this amendment, the terms “Employer,”
“Employee” and “Wage” shall have the meanings established under the
federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and its implementing regulations.
(c) MINIMUM WAGE. Employers shall pay Employees Wages no less than the
Minimum Wage for all hours worked in Florida. Six months after

$6.15. Effective September 30th, 2021, the existing state Minimum Wage
shall increase to $10.00 per hour, and then increase each September 30th
thereafter by $1.00 per hour, until the Minimum Wage reaches $15.00 per
hour on September 30th, 2026. On September 30th of 2027 and on each
following September 30th, the state Agency for Workforce Innovation
shall calculate an adjusted Minimum Wage rate by increasing the current
Minimum Wage rate by the rate of inflation during the twelve months
prior to each September 1st using the consumer price index for urban
wage earners and clerical workers, CPI-W, or a successor index as
calculated by the United States Department of Labor. Each adjusted
Minimum Wage rate calculated shall be published and take effect on the

towards satisfaction of the Minimum Wage tips up to the amount of the
allowable FLSA tip credit in 2003.

other party to discriminate in any manner or take adverse action against
any person in retaliation for exercising rights protected under this
amendment. Rights protected under this amendment include, but are not
limited to, the right to file a complaint or inform any person about any
party’s alleged noncompliance with this amendment, and the right to
inform any person of his or her potential rights under this amendment
and to assist him or her in asserting such rights.

bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an
Employer or person violating this amendment and, upon prevailing, shall
recover the full amount of any back wages unlawfully withheld plus the
same amount as liquidated damages, and shall be awarded reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs. In addition, they shall be entitled to such
legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation
including, without limitation, reinstatement in employment and/or
injunctive relief. Any Employer or other person found liable for
willfully violating this amendment shall also be subject to a fine
payable to the state in the amount of $1000.00 for each violation. The
state attorney general or other official designated by the state
legislature may also bring a civil action to enforce this amendment.
Actions to enforce this amendment shall be subject to a statute of
limitations of four years or, in the case of willful violations, five
years. Such actions may be brought as a class action pursuant to Rule
1.220 of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.
(f) ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND CONSTRUCTION. 
Implementing legislation is not required in order to enforce this
amendment. The state legislature may by statute establish additional
remedies or fines for violations of this amendment, raise the applicable
Minimum Wage rate, reduce the tip credit, or extend coverage of the
Minimum Wage to employers or employees not covered by this amendment.
The state legislature may by statute or the state Agency for Workforce
Innovation may by regulation adopt any measures appropriate for the
implementation of this amendment. This amendment provides for payment of
a minimum wage and shall not be construed to preempt or otherwise limit
the authority of the state legislature or any other public body to adopt
or enforce any other law, regulation, requirement, policy or standard
that provides for payment of higher or supplemental wages or benefits,
or that extends such protections to employers or employees not covered
by this amendment. It is intended that case law, administrative
interpretations, and other guiding standards developed under the federal
FLSA shall guide the construction of this amendment and any implementing
statutes or regulations.
(g) SEVERABILITY. If any part of this amendment, or the application of
this amendment to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the
remainder of this amendment, including the application of such part to
other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected by such a holding
and shall continue in full force and effect. To this end, the parts of
this amendment are severable.

(2) “Department” means the Department of Health or its successor agency.
(3) “Identification card” means a document issued by the Department that
identifies a qualifying patient or a caregiver.
(4) “Marijuana” has the meaning given cannabis in Section 893.02(3),
Florida Statutes (2014), and, in addition, “Low-THC cannabis” as defined
in Section 381.986(1)(b), Florida Statutes (2014), shall also be
included in the meaning of the term “marijuana.”
(5) “Medical Marijuana Treatment Center” (MMTC) means an entity that
acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including development of
related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments),
transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers
marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or
educational materials to qualifying patients or their caregivers and is
registered by the Department.

the treatment of a debilitating medical condition.

(d) DUTIES OF THE DEPARTMENT. The Department shall issue reasonable
regulations necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this
section. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure the availability
and safe use of medical marijuana by qualifying patients. It is the duty
of the Department to promulgate regulations in a timely fashion.
(1) Implementing Regulations. In order to allow the Department
sufficient time after passage of this section, the following regulations
shall be promulgated no later than six (6) months after the effective
date of this section:
a. Procedures for the issuance and annual renewal of qualifying patient

the issuance, renewal, suspension and revocation of registration, and
standards to ensure proper security, record keeping, testing, labeling,
inspection, and safety.
d. A regulation that defines the amount of marijuana that could
reasonably be presumed to be an adequate supply for qualifying patients’
medical use, based on the best available evidence. This presumption as

patient’s appropriate medical use.

issuing qualifying patient and caregiver identification cards, and
registering MMTCs no later than nine (9) months after the effective date
of this section.

patients. All records containing the identity of qualifying patients
shall be confidential and kept from public disclosure other than for
valid medical or law enforcement purposes.
(e) LEGISLATION. Nothing in this section shall limit the legislature
from enacting laws consistent with this section.
(f) SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this section are severable and if
any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this measure, or an
application thereof, is adjudged invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction other provisions shall continue to be in effect to the
fullest extent possible.
History.—Proposed by Initiative Petition filed with the Secretary of
State January 9, 2015; adopted 2016.
SECTION 30. Voter control of gambling in Florida.—
(a) This amendment ensures that Florida voters shall have the exclusive
right to decide whether to authorize casino gambling in the State of
Florida. This amendment requires a vote by citizens’ initiative pursuant
to Article XI, section 3, in order for casino gambling to be authorized
under Florida law. This section amends this Article; and also affects
Article XI, by making citizens’ initiatives the exclusive method of
authorizing casino gambling.
(b) As used in this section, “casino gambling” means any of the types of
games typically found in casinos and that are within the definition of
Class III gaming in the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.
ss. 2701 et seq. (“IGRA”), and in 25 C.F.R. s. 502.4, upon adoption of
this amendment, and any that are added to such definition of Class III
gaming in the future. This includes, but is not limited to, any house
banking game, including but not limited to card games such as baccarat,
chemin de fer, blackjack (21), and pai gow (if played as house banking
games); any player-banked game that simulates a house banking game, such
as California black jack; casino games such as roulette, craps, and
keno; any slot machines as defined in 15 U.S.C. s. 1171(a)(1); and any
other game not authorized by Article X, section 15, whether or not
defined as a slot machine, in which outcomes are determined by random
number generator or are similarly assigned randomly, such as instant or
historical racing. As used herein, “casino gambling” includes any
electronic gambling devices, simulated gambling devices, video lottery
devices, internet sweepstakes devices, and any other form of electronic
or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance, slot machine, or
casino-style game, regardless of how such devices are defined under
IGRA. As used herein, “casino gambling” does not include pari-mutuel
wagering on horse racing, dog racing, or jai alai exhibitions. For
purposes of this section, “gambling” and “gaming” are synonymous.
(c) Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of the Legislature
to exercise its authority through general law to restrict, regulate, or
tax any gaming or gambling activities. In addition, nothing herein shall
be construed to limit the ability of the state or Native American tribes
to negotiate gaming compacts pursuant to the Federal Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act for the conduct of casino gambling on tribal lands, or to
affect any existing gambling on tribal lands pursuant to compacts
executed by the state and Native American tribes pursuant to IGRA.
(d) This section is effective upon approval by the voters, is
self-executing, and no Legislative implementation is required.
(e) If any part of this section is held invalid for any reason, the
remaining portion or portions shall be severed from the invalid portion
and given the fullest possible force and effect.
History.—Proposed by Initiative Petition filed with the Secretary of
State October 26, 2015; adopted 2018.
SECTION 31. Death benefits for survivors of first responders and
military members.—
(a) A death benefit shall be paid by the employing agency when a
firefighter; a paramedic; an emergency medical technician; a law
enforcement, correctional, or correctional probation officer; or a
member of the Florida National Guard, while engaged in the performance
of their official duties, is:
(1) Accidentally killed or receives accidental bodily injury which
results in the loss of the individual’s life, provided that such killing
is not the result of suicide and that such bodily injury is not
intentionally self-inflicted; or
(2) Unlawfully and intentionally killed or dies as a result of such
unlawful and intentional act or is killed during active duty.
(b) A death benefit shall be paid by funds from general revenue when an
active duty member of the United States Armed Forces is:
(1) Accidentally killed or receives accidental bodily injury which
results in the loss of the individual’s life, provided that such killing
is not the result of suicide and that such bodily injury is not
intentionally self-inflicted; or
(2) Unlawfully and intentionally killed or dies as a result of such
unlawful and intentional act or is killed during active duty.
(c) If a firefighter; a paramedic; an emergency medical technician; a
law enforcement, correctional, or correctional probation officer; or an
active duty member of the Florida National Guard or United States Armed
Forces is accidentally killed as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and
(b)(1), or unlawfully and intentionally killed as specified in
paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2), the state shall waive certain educational
expenses that the child or spouse of the deceased first responder or
military member incurs while obtaining a career certificate, an
undergraduate education, or a postgraduate education.
(d) An eligible first responder must have been working for the State of
Florida or any of its political subdivisions or agencies at the time of
death. An eligible military member must have been a resident of this
state or his or her duty post must have been within this state at the
time of death.
(e) The legislature shall implement this section by general law.
(f) This section shall take effect on July 1, 2019.

2018, filed with the Secretary of State May 9, 2018; adopted 2018.
SECTION 32. Prohibition on racing of and wagering on greyhounds or other
dogs.—The humane treatment of animals is a fundamental value of the
people of the State of Florida. After December 31, 2020, a person
authorized to conduct gaming or pari-mutuel operations may not race
greyhounds or any member of the Canis Familiaris subspecies in
connection with any wager for money or any other thing of value in this
state, and persons in this state may not wager money or any other thing
of value on the outcome of a live dog race occurring in this state. The
failure to conduct greyhound racing or wagering on greyhound racing
after December 31, 2018, does not constitute grounds to revoke or deny
renewal of other related gaming licenses held by a person who is a
licensed greyhound permitholder on January 1, 2018, and does not affect
the eligibility of such permitholder, or such permitholder’s facility,
to conduct other pari-mutuel activities authorized by general law. By
general law, the legislature shall specify civil or criminal penalties
for violations of this section and for activities that aid or abet
violations of this section.

(a)(2), beginning July 1, 1975, all of the proceeds of the revenues
derived from the gross receipts taxes collected from every person,
including municipalities, as provided and levied pursuant to the
provisions of chapter 203, Florida Statutes, as such chapter is amended
from time to time, shall, as collected, be placed in a trust fund to be
known as the “public education capital outlay and debt service trust
fund” in the state treasury (hereinafter referred to as “capital outlay
fund”), and used only as provided herein.

The capital outlay fund shall be administered by the state board of
education as created and constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the
Constitution of Florida as revised in 1968 (hereinafter referred to as
“state board”), or by such other instrumentality of the state which
shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and functions of
the state board, including the powers, duties and functions of the state
board provided in this subsection (a)(2). The state board shall be a
body corporate and shall have all the powers provided herein in addition
to all other constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes
of this subsection (a)(2) heretofore or hereafter conferred by law upon
the state board, or its predecessor created by the Constitution of 1885,
as amended.

State bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be
issued, without a vote of the electors, by the state board pursuant to
law to finance or refinance capital projects theretofore authorized by
the legislature, and any purposes appurtenant or incidental thereto, for
the state system of public education provided for in Section 1 of
Article IX of this Constitution (hereinafter referred to as “state
system”), including but not limited to institutions of higher learning,
community colleges, vocational technical schools, or public schools, as
now defined or as may hereafter be defined by law. All such bonds shall
mature not later than thirty years after the date of issuance thereof.
All other details of such bonds shall be as provided by law or by the
proceedings authorizing such bonds; provided, however, that no bonds,
except refunding bonds, shall be issued, and no proceeds shall be
expended for the cost of any capital project, unless such project has
been authorized by the legislature.

Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (a)(2) shall be primarily
payable from such revenues derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall
be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of the state. No
such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of
the amount which the state board determines can be serviced by the
revenues derived from the gross receipts taxes accruing thereafter under
the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination shall
be conclusive.

The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used
only for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:

a. For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds due in
such fiscal year;
b. For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the
proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds of any amounts required to
be deposited in such reserve funds in such fiscal year;
c. For direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of any capital
project for the state system theretofore authorized by the legislature,
or for the purchase or redemption of outstanding bonds in accordance
with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized the issuance of
such bonds, or for the purpose of maintaining, restoring, or repairing
existing public educational facilities.
(b) REFUNDING BONDS. Revenue bonds to finance the cost of state capital
projects issued prior to the date this revision becomes effective,
including projects of the Florida state turnpike authority or its
successor but excluding all portions of the state highway system, may be
refunded as provided by law without vote of the electors at a lower net
average interest cost rate by the issuance of bonds maturing not later
than the obligations refunded, secured by the same revenues only.
(c) MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES.
(1) A state tax, designated “second gas tax,” of two cents per gallon
upon gasoline and other like products of petroleum and an equivalent tax
upon other sources of energy used to propel motor vehicles as levied by
4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is
hereby continued. The proceeds of said tax shall be placed monthly in
the state roads distribution fund in the state treasury.
(2) 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is
adopted by this reference as a part of this revision as completely as
though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of providing that
after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the “second
gas tax” as referred to therein shall be allocated among the several
counties in accordance with the formula stated therein to the extent
necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of
holders of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates
or any refundings thereof secured by any portion of the “second gas tax.”
(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in
4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall
be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter issued or entered
into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging
revenues allocated under said 4Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded
at a lower average net interest cost rate by the issuance of refunding
bonds, maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the
same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this
subsection.
(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and
after payment of administrative expenses, the “second gas tax” shall be
allocated to the account of each of the several counties in the amounts
to be determined as follows: There shall be an initial allocation of
one-fourth in the ratio of county area to state area, one-fourth in the
ratio of the total county population to the total population of the
state in accordance with the latest available federal census, and
one-half in the ratio of the total “second gas tax” collected on retail
sales or use in each county to the total collected in all counties of
the state during the previous fiscal year. If the annual debt service
requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including any
deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this
subsection, exceeds the amount which would be allocated to that county
under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts allocated to
other counties shall be reduced proportionately.
(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection
shall be administered by the state board of administration created under
Article IV, Section 4. The board shall remit the proceeds of the “second
gas tax” in each county account for use in said county as follows:
eighty per cent to the state agency supervising the state road system
and twenty per cent to the governing body of the county. The percentage
allocated to the county may be increased by general law. The proceeds of
the “second gas tax” subject to allocation to the several counties under
this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of obligations
pledging revenues allocated pursuant to 4Article IX, Section 16, of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended, and any refundings thereof; second,
for the payment of debt service on bonds issued as provided by this
paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as
defined by law; and third, for the acquisition and construction of roads
and for road maintenance as authorized by law. When authorized by law,
state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be
issued without any election: (i) to refund obligations secured by any
portion of the “second gas tax” allocated to a county under 4Article IX,
Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended; (ii) to finance the
acquisition and construction of roads in a county when approved by the
governing body of the county and the state agency supervising the state
road system; and (iii) to refund obligations secured by any portion of
the “second gas tax” allocated under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds
shall be issued unless a state fiscal agency created by law has made a
determination that in no state fiscal year will the debt service
requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged
portion of the “second gas tax” allocated to the county exceed
seventy-five per cent of the pledged portion of the “second gas tax”
allocated to that county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the
pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding
state fiscal year, and of the annual average net tolls anticipated
during the first five state fiscal years of operation of new projects to
be financed, and of any other legally available pledged revenues
collected in the preceding state fiscal year. Bonds issued pursuant to
this subsection shall be payable primarily from the pledged tolls, the
pledged portions of the “second gas tax” allocated to that county, and
any other pledged revenue, and shall mature not later than forty years
from the date of issuance.
(d) SCHOOL BONDS.
(1) 5Article XII, Section 9, Subsection (d) of this constitution, as
amended, (which, by reference, adopted 6Article XII, Section 18, of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended) as the same existed immediately before
the effective date of this amendment is adopted by this reference as
part of this amendment as completely as though incorporated herein
verbatim, for the purpose of providing that after the effective date of
this amendment the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the
licensing of motor vehicles as referred to therein shall be distributed
annually among the several counties in the ratio of the number of
instruction units in each county, the same being coterminus with the
school district of each county as provided in Article IX, Section 4,
Subsection (a) of this constitution, in each year computed as provided
therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for
the benefit of holders of bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates issued before the effective date of this amendment or any
refundings thereof which are secured by any portion of such revenues
derived from the licensing of motor vehicles.
(2) No funds anticipated to be distributed annually among the several
counties under the formula stated in 5Article XII, Section 9, Subsection
(d) of this constitution, as amended, as the same existed immediately
before the effective date of this amendment shall be pledged as security
for any obligations hereafter issued or entered into, except that any
outstanding obligations previously issued pledging such funds may be
refunded by the issuance of refunding bonds.
(3) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d)
beginning July 1, 1973, the first proceeds of the revenues derived from
the licensing of motor vehicles (hereinafter called “motor vehicle
license revenues”) to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions
of this amendment, shall, as collected, be placed monthly in the school
district and community college district capital outlay and debt service
fund in the state treasury and used only as provided in this amendment.
Such revenue shall be distributed annually among the several school
districts and community college districts in the ratio of the number of
instruction units in each school district or community college district
in each year computed as provided herein. The amount of the first motor
vehicle license revenues to be so set aside in each year and distributed
as provided herein shall be an amount equal in the aggregate to the
product of six hundred dollars ($600) multiplied by the total number of
instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the school
fiscal year 1967-68, plus an amount equal in the aggregate to the
product of eight hundred dollars ($800) multiplied by the total number
of instruction units in all the school districts of Florida for the
school fiscal year 1972-73 and for each school fiscal year thereafter
which is in excess of the total number of such instruction units in all
the school districts of Florida for the school fiscal year 1967-68, such
excess units being designated “growth units.” The amount of the first
motor vehicle license revenues to be so set aside in each year and
distributed as provided herein shall additionally be an amount equal in
the aggregate to the product of four hundred dollars ($400) multiplied
by the total number of instruction units in all community college
districts of Florida. The number of instruction units in each school
district or community college district in each year for the purposes of
this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the number of instruction
units in each school district for the school fiscal year 1967-68 or
community college district for the school fiscal year 1968-69 computed
in the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the number of
instruction units in such school district, including growth units, or
community college district for the school fiscal year computed in the
manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by
the state board of education (hereinafter called the state board), or
(3) the number of instruction units in each school district, including
growth units, or community college district on behalf of which the state
board has issued bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates under this amendment which will produce sufficient revenues
under this amendment to equal one and twelve-hundredths (1.12) times the
aggregate amount of principal of and interest on all bonds or motor
vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates issued under this
amendment which will mature and become due in such year, computed in the
manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by
the state board.
(4) Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board
as now created and constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the State
Constitution as revised in 1968, or by such other instrumentality of the
state which shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and
functions of the state board, including the powers, duties and functions
of the state board provided in this amendment. For the purposes of this
amendment, said state board shall be a body corporate and shall have all
the powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other
constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this
amendment heretofore or hereafter conferred upon said state board.
(5) The state board shall, in addition to its other constitutional and
statutory powers, have the management, control and supervision of the
proceeds of the first motor vehicle license revenues provided for in
this subsection (d). The state board shall also have power, for the
purpose of obtaining funds for the use of any school board of any school
district or board of trustees of any community college district in
acquiring, building, constructing, altering, remodeling, improving,
enlarging, furnishing, equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing
of capital outlay projects for school purposes to issue bonds or motor
vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, and also to issue
such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates to
pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates theretofore issued by said state board. All
such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
shall bear interest at not exceeding the rate provided by general law
and shall mature not later than thirty years after the date of issuance
thereof. The state board shall have power to determine all other details
of the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
and to sell in the manner provided by general law, or exchange the bonds
or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, upon such
terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.
(6) The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of
the principal of and interest on such bonds or motor vehicle license
revenue anticipation certificates, including refunding bonds or
refunding motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates, all
or any part from the motor vehicle license revenues provided for in this
amendment and to enter into any covenants and other agreements with the
holders of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates at the time of the issuance thereof concerning the security
thereof and the rights of the holders thereof, all of which covenants
and agreements shall constitute legally binding and irrevocable
contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable by such
holders in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(7) No such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates shall ever be issued by the state board, except to refund
outstanding bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates, until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the
issuance thereof by the school board of the school district or board of
trustees of the community college district on behalf of which the
obligations are to be issued. The state board of education shall limit
the amount of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates which can be issued on behalf of any school district or
community college district to ninety percent (90%) of the amount which
it determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to the school
district or community college district under the provisions of this
amendment, and shall determine the reasonable allocation of the interest
savings from the issuance of refunding bonds or motor vehicle license
revenue anticipation certificates, and such determinations shall be
conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates shall be issued in the name of the state board of education
but shall be issued for and on behalf of the school board of the school
district or board of trustees of the community college district
requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of
qualified electors shall be required for the issuance thereof.
(8) The state board shall in each year use the funds distributable
pursuant to this amendment to the credit of each school district or
community college district only in the following manner and in order of
priority:
a. To comply with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d).
b. To pay all amounts of principal and interest due in such year on any
bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates issued
under the authority hereof, including refunding bonds or motor vehicle
license revenue anticipation certificates, issued on behalf of the
school board of such school district or board of trustees of such
community college district; subject, however, to any covenants or
agreements made by the state board concerning the rights between holders
of different issues of such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue
anticipation certificates, as herein authorized.
c. To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future
requirements for debt service or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor
vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates issued on behalf of
the school board of such school district or board of trustees of such
community college district under the authority hereof, whenever the
state board shall deem it necessary or advisable, and in such amounts
and under such terms and conditions as the state board shall in its
discretion determine.
d. To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school
districts or the boards of trustees of the community college districts
for use in payment of debt service on bonds heretofore or hereafter
issued by any such school boards of the school districts or boards of
trustees of the community college districts where the proceeds of the
bonds were used, or are to be used, in the acquiring, building,
constructing, altering, remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing,
equipping, maintaining, renovating, or repairing of capital outlay
projects in such school districts or community college districts and
which capital outlay projects have been approved by the school board of
the school district or board of trustees of the community college
district, pursuant to the most recent survey or surveys conducted under
regulations prescribed by the state board to determine the capital
outlay needs of the school district or community college district. The
state board shall have power at the time of issuance of any bonds by any
school board of any school district or board of trustees of any
community college district to covenant and agree with such school board
or board of trustees as to the rank and priority of payments to be made
for different issues of bonds under this subparagraph d., and may
further agree that any amounts to be distributed under this subparagraph
d. may be pledged for the debt service on bonds issued by any school
board of any school district or board of trustees of any community
college district and for the rank and priority of such pledge. Any such
covenants or agreements of the state board may be enforced by any
holders of such bonds in any court of competent jurisdiction.
e. To pay the expenses of the state board in administering this
subsection (d), which shall be prorated among the various school
districts and community college districts and paid out of the proceeds
of the bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation certificates
or from the funds distributable to each school district and community
college district on the same basis as such motor vehicle license
revenues are distributable to the various school districts and community
college districts.
f. To distribute annually to the several school boards of the school
districts or boards of trustees of the community college districts for
the payment of the cost of acquiring, building, constructing, altering,
remodeling, improving, enlarging, furnishing, equipping, maintaining,
renovating, or repairing of capital outlay projects for school purposes
in such school district or community college district as shall be
requested by resolution of the school board of the school district or
board of trustees of the community college district.
g. When all major capital outlay needs of a school district or community
college district have been met as determined by the state board, on the
basis of a survey made pursuant to regulations of the state board and
approved by the state board, all such funds remaining shall be
distributed annually and used for such school purposes in such school
district or community college district as the school board of the school
district or board of trustees of the community college district shall
determine, or as may be provided by general law.
(9) Capital outlay projects of a school district or community college
district shall be eligible to participate in the funds accruing under
this amendment and derived from the proceeds of bonds and motor vehicle
license revenue anticipation certificates and from the motor vehicle
license revenues, only in the order of priority of needs, as shown by a
survey or surveys conducted in the school district or community college
district under regulations prescribed by the state board, to determine
the capital outlay needs of the school district or community college
district and approved by the state board; provided that the priority of
such projects may be changed from time to time upon the request of the
school board of the school district or board of trustees of the
community college district and with the approval of the state board; and
provided, further, that this paragraph (9) shall not in any manner
affect any covenant, agreement or pledge made by the state board in the
issuance by said state board of any bonds or motor vehicle license
revenue anticipation certificates, or in connection with the issuance of
any bonds of any school board of any school district or board of
trustees of any community college district.
(10) The state board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and
regulations necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein granted
and no legislation shall be required to render this amendment of full
force and operating effect. The legislature shall not reduce the levies
of said motor vehicle license revenues during the life of this amendment
to any degree which will fail to provide the full amount necessary to
comply with the provisions of this amendment and pay the necessary
expenses of administering the laws relating to the licensing of motor
vehicles, and shall not enact any law having the effect of withdrawing
the proceeds of such motor vehicle license revenues from the operation
of this amendment and shall not enact any law impairing or materially
altering the rights of the holders of any bonds or motor vehicle license
revenue anticipation certificates issued pursuant to this amendment or
impairing or altering any covenant or agreement of the state board, as
provided in such bonds or motor vehicle license revenue anticipation
certificates.
(11) Bonds issued by the state board pursuant to this subsection (d)
shall be payable primarily from said motor vehicle license revenues as
provided herein, and if heretofore or hereafter authorized by law, may
be additionally secured by pledging the full faith and credit of the
state without an election. When heretofore or hereafter authorized by
law, bonds issued pursuant to 6Article XII, Section 18 of the
Constitution of 1885, as amended prior to 1968, and bonds issued
pursuant to Article XII, Section 9, subsection (d) of the Constitution
as revised in 1968, and bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (d),
may be refunded by the issuance of bonds additionally secured by the
full faith and credit of the state.
(e) DEBT LIMITATION. Bonds issued pursuant to this Section 9 of Article
XII which are payable primarily from revenues pledged pursuant to this
section shall not be included in applying the limits upon the amount of
state bonds contained in Section 11, Article VII, of this revision.

of 1885, as amended, as it existed immediately before this Constitution,
as revised in 1968, became effective, is adopted by this reference as a
part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein

incorporated herein verbatim, except bonds or tax anticipation
certificates hereafter issued thereunder may bear interest not in excess

of the legislature. No revenue bonds or tax anticipation certificates
shall be issued pursuant thereto after June 30, 1975.

3Note.—Section 19 of Art. XII of the Constitution of 1885, as amended,
reads as follows:

SECTION 19. Institutions of higher learning and junior college capital
outlay trust fund bonds.—(a) That beginning January 1, 1964, and for
fifty years thereafter, all of the proceeds of the revenues derived from
the gross receipts taxes collected from every person, including
municipalities, receiving payment for electricity for light, heat or
power, for natural or manufactured gas for light, heat or power, for use
of telephones and for the sending of telegrams and telegraph messages,
as now provided and levied as of the time of adoption of this amendment
in Chapter 203, Florida Statutes (hereinafter called “Gross Receipts
Taxes”), shall, as collected be placed in a trust fund to be known as
the “Institutions of Higher Learning and Junior Colleges Capital Outlay
and Debt Service Trust Fund” in the State Treasury (hereinafter referred
to as “Capital Outlay Fund”), and used only as provided in this Amendment.

Said fund shall be administered by the State Board of Education, as now
created and constituted by Section 3 of Article XII [now s. 2, Article
IX] of the Constitution of Florida (hereinafter referred to as “State
Board”). For the purpose of this Amendment, said State Board, as now
constituted, shall continue as a body corporate during the life of this
Amendment and shall have all the powers provided in this Amendment in
addition to all other constitutional and statutory powers related to the
purposes of this Amendment heretofore or hereafter conferred by law upon
said State Board.

(b) The State Board shall have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds
for acquiring, building, constructing, altering, improving, enlarging,
furnishing or equipping capital outlay projects theretofore authorized
by the legislature and any purposes appurtenant or incidental thereto,
for Institutions of Higher Learning or Junior Colleges, as now defined
or as may be hereafter defined by law, and for the purpose of
constructing buildings and other permanent facilities for vocational
technical schools as provided in chapter 230 Florida Statutes, to issue
bonds or certificates, including refunding bonds or certificates to fund
or refund any bonds or certificates theretofore issued. All such bonds
or certificates shall bear interest at not exceeding four and one-half
per centum per annum, and shall mature at such time or times as the
State Board shall determine not exceeding, in any event, however, thirty
years from the date of issuance thereof. The State Board shall have
power to determine all other details of such bonds or certificates and
to sell at public sale, after public advertisement, such bonds or
certificates, provided, however, that no bonds or certificates shall
ever be issued hereunder to finance, or the proceeds thereof expended
for, any part of the cost of any capital outlay project unless the
construction or acquisition of such capital outlay project has been
theretofore authorized by the Legislature of Florida. None of said bonds
or certificates shall be sold at less than ninety-eight per centum of
the par value thereof, plus accrued interest, and said bonds or
certificates shall be awarded at the public sale thereof to the bidder
offering the lowest net interest cost for such bonds or certificates in
the manner to be determined by the State Board.

The State Board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the
principal of and interest on such bonds or certificates, and reserves
therefor, including refunding bonds or certificates, all or any part of
the revenue to be derived from the said Gross Receipts Taxes provided
for in this Amendment, and to enter into any covenants and other
agreements with the holders of such bonds or certificates concerning the
security thereof and the rights of the holders thereof, all of which
covenants and agreements shall constitute legally binding and
irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable
by such holders in any court of competent jurisdiction.

No such bonds or certificates shall ever be issued by the State Board in
an amount exceeding seventy-five per centum of the amount which it
determines, based upon the average annual amount of the revenues derived
from said Gross Receipts Taxes during the immediately preceding two
fiscal years, or the amount of the revenues derived from said Gross
Receipts Taxes during the immediately preceding fiscal year, as shown in
a certificate filed by the State Comptroller with the State Board prior
to the issuance of such bonds or certificates, whichever is the lesser,
can be serviced by the revenues accruing thereafter under the provisions
of this Amendment; nor shall the State Board, during the first year
following the ratification of this amendment, issue bonds or
certificates in excess of seven times the anticipated revenue from said
Gross Receipts Taxes during said year, nor during each succeeding year,
more than four times the anticipated revenue from said Gross Receipts
Taxes during such year. No election or approval of qualified electors or
freeholder electors shall be required for the issuance of bonds or
certificates hereunder.

After the initial issuance of any bonds or certificates pursuant to this
Amendment, the State Board may thereafter issue additional bonds or
certificates which will rank equally and on a parity, as to lien on and
source of security for payment from said Gross Receipts Taxes, with any
bonds or certificates theretofore issued pursuant to this Amendment, but
such additional parity bonds or certificates shall not be issued unless
the average annual amount of the revenues derived from said Gross
Receipts Taxes during the immediately preceding two fiscal years, or the
amount of the revenues derived from said Gross Receipts Taxes during the
immediately preceding fiscal year, as shown in a certificate filed by
the State Comptroller with the State Board prior to the issuance of such
bonds or certificates, whichever is the lesser, shall have been equal to
one and one-third times the aggregate amount of principal and interest
which will become due in any succeeding fiscal year on all bonds or
certificates theretofore issued pursuant to this Amendment and then
outstanding, and the additional parity bonds or certificates then
proposed to be issued. No bonds, certificates or other obligations
whatsoever shall at any time be issued under the provisions of this
Amendment, except such bonds or certificates initially issued hereunder,
and such additional parity bonds or certificates as provided in this
paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision herein no such bonds or
certificates shall be authorized or validated during any biennium in
excess of fifty million dollars, except by two-thirds vote of the
members elected to each house of the legislature; provided further that
during the biennium 1963-1965 seventy-five million dollars may be
authorized and validated pursuant hereto.

(c) Capital outlay projects theretofore authorized by the legislature
for any Institution of Higher Learning or Junior College shall be
eligible to participate in the funds accruing under this Amendment
derived from the proceeds of bonds or certificates and said Gross
Receipts Taxes under such regulations and in such manner as shall be
determined by the State Board, and the State Board shall use or transmit
to the State Board of Control or to the Board of Public Instruction of
any County authorized by law to construct or acquire such capital outlay
projects, the amount of the proceeds of such bonds or certificates or
Gross Receipts Taxes to be applied to or used for such capital outlay
projects. If for any reason any of the proceeds of any bonds or
certificates issued for any capital outlay project shall not be expended
for such capital outlay project, the State Board may use such unexpended
proceeds for any other capital outlay project for Institutions of Higher
Learning or Junior Colleges and vocational technical schools, as defined
herein, as now defined or as may be hereafter defined by law,
theretofore authorized by the State Legislature. The holders of bonds or
certificates issued hereunder shall not have any responsibility
whatsoever for the application or use of any of the proceeds derived
from the sale of said bonds or certificates, and the rights and remedies
of the holders of such bonds or certificates and their right to payment
from said Gross Receipts Taxes in the manner provided herein shall not
be affected or impaired by the application or use of such proceeds.

The State Board shall use the moneys in said Capital Outlay Fund in each
fiscal year only for the following purposes and in the following order
of priority:

(1) For the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds or
certificates maturing in such fiscal year.

(2) For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the
proceedings authorizing the issuance of said bonds or certificates, of
any amounts required to be deposited in such reserve funds in such
fiscal year.

(3) After all payments required in such fiscal year for the purposes
provided for in (1) and (2) above, including any deficiencies for
required payments in prior fiscal years, any moneys remaining in said
Capital Outlay Fund at the end of such fiscal year may be used by the
State Board for direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of
any capital outlay project theretofore authorized by the legislature or
for the purchase of any bonds or certificates issued hereunder then
outstanding upon such terms and conditions as the State Board shall deem
proper, or for the prior redemption of outstanding bonds or certificates
in accordance with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized
the issuance of such bonds or certificates.

The State Board may invest the moneys in said Capital Outlay Fund or in
any sinking fund or other funds created for any issue of bonds or
certificates, in direct obligations of the United States of America or
in the other securities referred to in Section 344.27, Florida Statutes.

(d) The State Board shall have the power to make and enforce all rules
and regulations necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein
granted and no legislation shall be required to render this Amendment of
full force and operating effect on and after January 1, 1964. The
Legislature, during the period this Amendment is in effect, shall not
reduce the rate of said Gross Receipts Taxes now provided in said
Chapter 203, Florida Statutes, or eliminate, exempt or remove any of the
persons, firms or corporations, including municipal corporations, or any
of the utilities, businesses or services now or hereafter subject to
said Gross Receipts Taxes, from the levy and collection of said Gross
Receipts Taxes as now provided in said Chapter 203, Florida Statutes,
and shall not enact any law impairing or materially altering the rights
of the holders of any bonds or certificates issued pursuant to this
Amendment or impairing or altering any covenants or agreements of the
State Board made hereunder, or having the effect of withdrawing the
proceeds of said Gross Receipts Taxes from the operation of this Amendment.

their compensation for the administration of the provisions of this
Amendment as it shall deem necessary, and the expenses of the State
Board in administering the provisions of this Amendment shall be paid
out of the proceeds of bonds or certificates issued hereunder or from
said Gross Receipts Taxes deposited in said Capital Outlay Fund.

hereunder unless the bill authorizing such project shall specify it is
financed hereunder and shall be approved by a vote of three-fifths of
the elected members of each house.

4Note.—Section 16 of Art. IX of the Constitution of 1885, as amended,
reads as follows:

SECTION 16. Board of administration; gasoline and like taxes,
distribution and use; etc.—(a) That beginning January 1st, 1943, and for
fifty (50) years thereafter, the proceeds of two (2¢) cents per gallon
of the total tax levied by state law upon gasoline and other like
products of petroleum, now known as the Second Gas Tax, and upon other
fuels used to propel motor vehicles, shall as collected be placed
monthly in the ‘State Roads Distribution Fund’ in the State Treasury and
divided into three (3) equal parts which shall be distributed monthly
among the several counties as follows: one part according to area, one
part according to population, and one part according to the counties’
contributions to the cost of state road construction in the ratio of
distribution as provided in Chapter 15659, Laws of Florida, Acts of
1931, and for the purposes of the apportionment based on the counties’
contributions for the cost of state road construction, the amount of the
contributions established by the certificates made in 1931 pursuant to
said Chapter 15659, shall be taken and deemed conclusive in computing
the monthly amounts distributable according to said contributions. Such
funds so distributed shall be administered by the State Board of
Administration as hereinafter provided.

(b) The Governor as chairman, the State Treasurer, and the State
Comptroller shall constitute a body corporate to be known as the ‘State
Board of Administration,’ which board shall succeed to all the power,
control and authority of the statutory Board of Administration. Said
Board shall have, in addition to such powers as may be conferred upon it
by law, the management, control and supervision of the proceeds of said
two (2¢) cents of said taxes and all moneys and other assets which on
the effective date of this amendment are applicable or may become
applicable to the bonds of the several counties of this state, or any
special road and bridge district, or other special taxing district
thereof, issued prior to July 1st, 1931, for road and bridge purposes.
The word ‘bonds’ as used herein shall include bonds, time warrants,
notes and other forms of indebtedness issued for road and bridge
purposes by any county or special road and bridge district or other
special taxing district, outstanding on July 1st, 1931, or any refunding
issues thereof. Said Board shall have the statutory powers of Boards of
County Commissioners and Bond Trustees and of any other authority of
special road and bridge districts, and other special taxing districts
thereof with regard to said bonds, (except that the power to levy ad
valorem taxes is expressly withheld from said Board), and shall take
over all papers, documents and records concerning the same. Said Board
shall have the power from time to time to issue refunding bonds to
mature within the said fifty (50) year period, for any of said
outstanding bonds or interest thereon, and to secure them by a pledge of
anticipated receipts from such gasoline or other fuel taxes to be
distributed to such county as herein provided, but not at a greater rate
of interest than said bonds now bear; and to issue, sell or exchange on
behalf of any county or unit for the sole purpose of retiring said bonds
issued by such county, or special road and bridge district, or other
special taxing district thereof, gasoline or other fuel tax anticipation
certificates bearing interest at not more than three (3) per cent per
annum in such denominations and maturing at such time within the fifty
(50) year period as the board may determine. In addition to exercising
the powers now provided by statute for the investment of sinking funds,
said Board may use the sinking funds created for said bonds of any
county or special road and bridge district, or other unit hereunder, to
purchase the matured or maturing bonds participating herein of any other
county or any other special road and bridge district, or other special
taxing district thereof, provided that as to said matured bonds, the
value thereof as an investment shall be the price paid therefor, which
shall not exceed the par value plus accrued interest, and that said
investment shall bear interest at the rate of three (3) per cent per annum.

(c) The said board shall annually use said funds in each county account,
first, to pay current principal and interest maturing, if any, of said
bonds and gasoline or other fuel tax anticipation certificates of such
county or special road and bridge district, or other special taxing
district thereof; second, to establish a sinking fund account to meet
future requirements of said bonds and gasoline or other fuel tax
anticipation certificates where it appears the anticipated income for
any year or years will not equal scheduled payments thereon; and third,
any remaining balance out of the proceeds of said two (2¢) cents of said
taxes shall monthly during the year be remitted by said board as
follows: Eighty (80%) per cent to the State Road Department for the
construction or reconstruction of state roads and bridges within the
county, or for the lease or purchase of bridges connecting state
highways within the county, and twenty (20%) per cent to the Board of
County Commissioners of such county for use on roads and bridges therein.

(d) Said board shall have the power to make and enforce all rules and
regulations necessary to the full exercise of the powers hereby granted
and no legislation shall be required to render this amendment of full
force and operating effect from and after January 1st, 1943. The
Legislature shall continue the levies of said taxes during the life of
this Amendment, and shall not enact any law having the effect of
withdrawing the proceeds of said two (2¢) cents of said taxes from the
operation of this amendment. The board shall pay refunding expenses and
other expenses for services rendered specifically for, or which are
properly chargeable to, the account of any county from funds distributed
to such county; but general expenses of the board for services rendered
all the counties alike shall be prorated among them and paid out of said
funds on the same basis said tax proceeds are distributed among the
several counties; provided, report of said expenses shall be made to
each Regular Session of the Legislature, and the Legislature may limit
the expenses of the board.

History.—Added, S.J.R. 324, 1941; adopted 1942.

5Note.—Prior to its amendment by C.S. for H.J.R. 3576, 1972, subsection
(d) read as follows:

(d) SCHOOL BONDS. Article XII, Section 18, of the Constitution of 1885,
as amended, as it existed immediately before this revision becomes
effective is adopted by this reference as part of this revision as
completely as though incorporated herein verbatim, except bonds or tax
anticipation certificates hereafter issued thereunder may bear interest
not in excess of five per cent per annum or such higher interest as may
be authorized by statute passed by a three-fifths vote of each house of
the legislature. Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (d) shall be
payable primarily from revenues as provided in Article XII, Section 18,
of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, and if authorized by law, may
be additionally secured by pledging the full faith and credit of the
state without an election. When authorized by law, bonds issued pursuant
to Article XII, Section 18, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, and
bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (d), may be refunded by the
issuance of bonds additionally secured by the full faith and credit of
the state only at a lower net average interest cost rate.

6Note.—Section 18, Art. XII of the Constitution of 1885, as amended,
reads as follows:

SECTION 18. School bonds for capital outlay, issuance.—

(a) Beginning January 1, 1965 and for thirty-five years thereafter, the
first proceeds of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor
vehicles to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this
amendment, shall, as collected, be placed monthly in the county capital
outlay and debt service school fund in the state treasury, and used only
as provided in this amendment. Such revenue shall be distributed
annually among the several counties in the ratio of the number of
instruction units in each county in each year computed as provided
herein. The amount of the first revenues derived from the licensing of
motor vehicles to be so set aside in each year and distributed as
provided herein shall be an amount equal in the aggregate to the product
of four hundred dollars multiplied by the total number of instruction
units in all the counties of Florida. The number of instruction units in
each county in each year for the purposes of this amendment shall be the
greater of (1) the number of instruction units in each county for the
school fiscal year 1951-52 computed in the manner heretofore provided by
general law, or (2) the number of instruction units in such county for
the school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter
provided by general law and approved by the state board of education
(hereinafter called the state board), or (3) the number of instruction
units in each county on behalf of which the state board of education has
issued bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates under this
amendment which will produce sufficient revenues under this amendment to
equal one and one-third times the aggregate amount of principal of and
interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates
which will mature and become due in such year, computed in the manner
heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by the
state board.

Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as
now created and constituted by Section 3 of Article XII [now s. 2,
Article IX] of the Constitution of Florida. For the purposes of this
amendment, said state board, as now constituted, shall continue as a
body corporate during the life of this amendment and shall have all the
powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other
constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this
amendment heretofore or hereafter conferred upon said board.

(b) The state board shall, in addition to its other constitutional and
statutory powers, have the management, control and supervision of the
proceeds of the first part of the revenues derived from the licensing of
motor vehicles provided for in subsection (a). The state board shall
also have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds for the use of any
county board of public instruction in acquiring, building, constructing,
altering, improving, enlarging, furnishing, or equipping capital outlay
projects for school purposes, to issue bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle
tax anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates theretofore issued by said state
board. All such bonds shall bear interest at not exceeding four and
one-half per centum per annum and shall mature serially in annual
installments commencing not more than three years from the date of
issuance thereof and ending not later than thirty years from the date of
issuance or January 1, 2000, A.D., whichever is earlier. All such motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall bear interest at not
exceeding four and one-half per centum per annum and shall mature prior
to January 1, 2000, A.D. The state board shall have power to determine
all other details of said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates and to sell at public sale after public advertisement, or
exchange said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, upon
such terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.

The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the
principal of and interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates, including refunding bonds or refunding motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates, all or any part from the
anticipated revenues to be derived from the licensing of motor vehicles
provided for in this amendment and to enter into any covenants and other
agreements with the holders of such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates at the time of the issuance thereof concerning
the security thereof and the rights of the holders thereof, all of which
covenants and agreements shall constitute legally binding and
irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable
by such holders in any court of competent jurisdiction.

No such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall ever
be issued by the state board until after the adoption of a resolution
requesting the issuance thereof by the county board of public
instruction of the county on behalf of which such obligations are to be
issued. The state board of education shall limit the amount of such
bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which can be issued
on behalf of any county to seventy-five per cent of the amount which it
determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to the county under
the provisions of this amendment, and such determination shall be
conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates shall be issued in the name of the state board of education
but shall be issued for and on behalf of the county board of public
instruction requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval
of qualified electors or freeholders shall be required for the issuance
thereof.

(c) The State Board shall in each year use the funds distributable
pursuant to this Amendment to the credit of each county only in the
following manner and order of priority:

(1) To pay all amounts of principal and interest maturing in such year
on any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued under
the authority hereof, including refunding bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates, issued on behalf of the Board of Public
Instruction of such county; subject, however, to any covenants or
agreements made by the State Board concerning the rights between holders
of different issues of such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation
certificates, as herein authorized.

(2) To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future
requirements for debt service, or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued on behalf of the Board of
Public Instruction of such county, under the authority hereof, whenever
the State Board shall deem it necessary or advisable, and in such
amounts and under such terms and conditions as the State Board shall in
its discretion determine.

(3) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction
of the counties for use in payment of debt service on bonds heretofore
or hereafter issued by any such Board where the proceeds of the bonds
were used, or are to be used, in the construction, acquisition,
improvement, enlargement, furnishing, or equipping of capital outlay
projects in such county, and which capital outlay projects have been
approved by the Board of Public Instruction of the county, pursuant to a
survey or surveys conducted subsequent to July 1, 1947 in the county,
under regulations prescribed by the State Board to determine the capital
outlay needs of the county.

The State Board shall have power at the time of issuance of any bonds by
any Board of Public Instruction to covenant and agree with such Board as
to the rank and priority of payments to be made for different issues of
bonds under this Subsection (3), and may further agree that any amounts
to be distributed under this Subsection (3) may be pledged for the debt
service on bonds issued by any Board of Public Instruction and for the
rank and priority of such pledge. Any such covenants or agreements of
the State Board may be enforced by any holders of such bonds in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

(4) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction
of the counties for the payment of the cost of the construction,
acquisition, improvement, enlargement, furnishing, or equipping of
capital outlay projects for school purposes in such county as shall be
requested by resolution of the County Board of Public Instruction of
such county.

(5) When all major capital outlay needs of a county have been met as
determined by the State Board, on the basis of a survey made pursuant to
regulations of the State Board and approved by the State Board, all such
funds remaining shall be distributed annually and used for such school
purposes in such county as the Board of Public Instruction of the county
shall determine, or as may be provided by general law.

(d) Capital outlay projects of a county shall be eligible to participate
in the funds accruing under this Amendment and derived from the proceeds
of bonds and motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates and from the
motor vehicle license taxes, only in the order of priority of needs, as
shown by a survey or surveys conducted in the county under regulations
prescribed by the State Board, to determine the capital outlay needs of
the county and approved by the State Board; provided, that the priority
of such projects may be changed from time to time upon the request of
the Board of Public Instruction of the county and with the approval of
the State Board; and provided further, that this Subsection (d) shall
not in any manner affect any covenant, agreement, or pledge made by the
State Board in the issuance by said State Board of any bonds or motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates, or in connection with the
issuance of any bonds of any Board of Public Instruction of any county.

(e) The State Board may invest any sinking fund or funds created
pursuant to this Amendment in direct obligations of the United States of
America or in the bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates,
matured or to mature, issued by the State Board on behalf of the Board
of Public Instruction of any county.

(f) The State Board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and
regulations necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein granted
and no legislation shall be required to render this Amendment of full
force and operating effect from and after January 1, 1953. The
Legislature shall not reduce the levies of said motor vehicle license
taxes during the life of this Amendment to any degree which will fail to
provide the full amount necessary to comply with the provisions of this
Amendment and pay the necessary expenses of administering the laws
relating to the licensing of motor vehicles, and shall not enact any law
having the effect of withdrawing the proceeds of such motor vehicle
license taxes from the operation of this Amendment and shall not enact
any law impairing or materially altering the rights of the holders of
any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued pursuant
to this Amendment or impairing or altering any covenant or agreement of
the State Board, as provided in such bonds or motor vehicle tax
anticipation certificates.

The State Board shall have power to appoint such persons and fix their
compensation for the administration of the provisions of this Amendment
as it shall deem necessary, and the expenses of the State Board in
administering the provisions of this Amendment shall be prorated among
the various counties and paid out of the proceeds of the bonds or motor
vehicle tax anticipation certificates or from the funds distributable to
each county on the same basis as such motor vehicle license taxes are
distributable to the various counties under the provisions of this
Amendment. Interest or profit on sinking fund investments shall accrue
to the counties in proportion to their respective equities in the
sinking fund or funds.
