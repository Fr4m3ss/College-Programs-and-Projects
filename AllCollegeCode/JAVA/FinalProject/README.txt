Francesco Messina, Final Project, Checkers

CHECKERS RULES:
-The opponent with the light pieces moves first. 

-Pieces may only move one diagonal space forward (towards their opponents pieces)
 in the beginning of the game. Pieces must stay on the dark squares. 

-To capture an opposing piece, "jump" over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the
 direction of the the opposing piece. 

-Keep in mind, the space on the other side of your opponent’s piece must be empty
 for you to capture it. 

-If your piece reaches the last row on your opponent's side, that piece becomes
 "crowned", thereby making it a "King Piece." 

-King pieces may still only move one space at a time during a non-capturing move,
 but in any direction it pleases. King pieces may also attack from any direction,
 as long as the attack is a valid move.

-There is no limit to how many king pieces a player may have.

-”Double Jumping”, or any other variations are not allowed. Only single jumps are
 allowed in this game.
