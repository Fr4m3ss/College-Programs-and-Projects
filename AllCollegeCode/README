Directory Access
----------------


Your account has been set up so that your home directory can only be
accessed by you, that is, other users cannot read files in your home
directory.  It has been set up this way primarily to protect new users
who are unfamiliar with the UNIX file system and protection modes.

However, there are programs that need access to your home directory. 
The "finger" command, for example, looks in your home directory for a
file named ".plan".  If your directory is protected it cannot read this
file and anyone who uses the "finger" command to find out information
about you will get the message that "Plan file exists, but is unreadable."

If you would like the files in your home directory to be accessible to
other users, you will need to use the "chmod" command to change the
permissions on your home directory.  You can then create sub-directories
to for any files that you want to keep private.

Example
-------

This will work on both the UNIX and DOS machines in the lab:
NOTE:  replace <text> with the appropriate names, for example:  mkdir prog1

	cd ..		       # move up one directory

	chmod 755 <username>   # change your home directory so that anyone 
			       # can read the files in your home directory.

	cd <username>	       # go back to your home directory

	mkdir <directory_name> # make a new directory 

	chmod 700 <directory_name> # set the permissions on the directory 
			           # so that only you have access to it

	ls -l		       # provides a long listing of files which shows 
			       # the permissions of files and directories

   ** Refer to the manual pages for more info on cd, chmod, mkdir, and ls
	by typing man <command_name> (ie. man cd, man chmod, etc.)  **
